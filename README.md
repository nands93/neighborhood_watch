# Hyper-Local Community Alert System (Temporary Name: Neighborhood Watch)

> ## üöß Status: In development üöß

A work-in-progress platform for community safety: report and visualize neighborhood alerts on an interactive map, with real-time updates and secure user authentication.

## ‚ú® Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| Backend | Go, Gin Framework |
| Database | PostgreSQL with PostGIS |
| Real-Time | WebSockets (Gorilla/Nhooyr) |
| Authentication | JWT with Password Hashing (Argon2) |
| Infrastructure | Docker, Docker Compose |
| Frontend | React (Vite), Leaflet.js (Map) |
| Automation | Makefile |

## üöÄ Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GNU Make (recommended)

1) Configure environment
- Set required env vars via a `.env` file or directly in `docker-compose.yml` (DB credentials, service ports, etc.).

2) Start the stack (recommended)
- `make up` ‚Äî build and start all services
- `make down` ‚Äî stop and remove services/volumes
- Check the Makefile for additional targets

Alternative (without make):
- `docker compose up -d`
- `docker compose down -v`

Notes:
- Exposed ports and service URLs are defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- First startup may initialize the database (including PostGIS) and admin tooling.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

- Backend: Go (Gin), exposes a REST API, handles auth, validation, and DB access.
- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data (alerts, locations).
- Frontend: React (Vite) with Leaflet.js for the interactive map.
- Real-time: WebSockets for live alert updates (planned).
- Infrastructure: Docker + Docker Compose for local development; Makefile for automation.

For deeper details (repository layout, database schema, security choices, etc.), see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
